## 🔍 **Algorithm**
This editor uses a **CRDT (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type)** algorithm to manage real-time collaborative editing and prevent conflicts when multiple users edit the document at the same time.

Each character in the document is treated as a node in a distributed data structure. The algorithm resolves conflicts by assigning priorities based on user operations and timestamps.
